# PTOX11 — Porsche Market Intelligence Platform
*Last updated: April 19, 2026 (PWA push notifications)*

---

## 1. Project Overview

Autonomous Porsche market intelligence platform on a Mac Mini M4. Scrapes 10 sources every 12 minutes, scores every listing against FMV using 6,010 BaT sold comps, and fires **native iOS push notifications** the moment a new listing enters the DB.

**Repo:** https://github.com/OCX11/PTOX11  
**Dashboard:** https://ocx11.github.io/PTOX11/  
**Auctions:** https://ocx11.github.io/PTOX11/auctions.html  
**Machine:** Mac Mini M4, user: claw, 24/7

### Business Context
Small performance car dealership. All purchases are investments. Core range $70K–$150K, GT/collector no ceiling.

## 3. Active Sources (April 18, 2026)

| Source | Active | Method | Images |
|---|---|---|---|
| DuPont Registry | ~889 | Direct API (api.dupontregistry.com POST) | ✅ 100% |
| eBay Motors | ~662 | Browse API OAuth2, cache+incremental+seller sweep | ✅ 100% |
| cars.com | ~269 | curl_cffi, 5 model slugs, VIN-stop incremental | ✅ 99% |
| Bring a Trailer | 42 | Playwright | ✅ 100% |
| PCA Mart | 32 | Playwright cookie-auth | ✅ CDN URLs stored |
| Cars and Bids | 11 | Playwright scroll | ✅ 100% |
| Built for Backroads | 11 | curl_cffi | ✅ 100% |
| pcarmarket | 10 | Playwright | ✅ 100% |
| AutoTrader | 8 | curl_cffi + headless PW fallback | ⚠️ 80% |
| Rennlist | 5 | curl_cffi (Cloudflare bypass) | ✅ 100% |

**Total active: ~1,939 listings. All local — zero Distill dependency.**

### DuPont Registry — key notes
- API: POST api.dupontregistry.com/api/v1/en_US/car/list, filter carBrand=[14], currentPage pagination
- URL format: /autos/listing/{year}/porsche/{model-alias}/{id} — CRITICAL, old format redirects to /dealers
- upsert_listing matches DuPont by car ID tail (last /\d+) to survive URL changes
- model inferred from carModel.name (e.g. "Carrera 4S" → model=911, trim=Carrera 4S)

### eBay Motors — key notes
- holtmotorsports seller sweep runs every cycle (owner's own listings)
- Dedup by listing_url first (not year/model) — fixes relist timestamp problem
- 20-min alert window guard prevents bulk re-ingestion storms

## 5. Database

### Tables
- **listings** — active + sold. Key columns: `dealer`, `year`, `make`, `model`, `trim`, `mileage`, `price`, `vin`, `listing_url`, `image_url`, `image_url_cdn`, `source_category`, `tier`, `created_at`, `date_first_seen`, `date_last_seen`, `auction_ends_at`, `status`, `feed_type`
- **price_history** — every price change per listing (silent tracking, no alerts)
- **sold_comps** — 6,010 records, 84% with generation filled. Auto-expires >24mo on each comp scrape run.
- **bat_reserve_not_met** — BaT auctions that didn't meet reserve (price floor signal)
- **snapshots** — daily raw snapshots per dealer

### upsert_listing dedup priority
1. VIN match (most reliable)
2. listing_url match (catches eBay/DuPont correctly)
3. DuPont fallback: car ID tail match (survives URL format changes)
4. year/make/model fallback (non-eBay, non-DuPont only)

### FMV Engine
- Source: BaT sold comps (weight 1.0), recency decay ≤6 months full → 0.3 at 24 months
- Groups by: generation + trim family
- Confidence: HIGH (10+ comps) / MEDIUM (4-9) / LOW (1-3) / NONE (0)
- Current: 78% HIGH, 22% MEDIUM, <1% LOW

## 9. Open Items / Roadmap

### Next up (approved)
1. **PWA push notifications** — replace iMessage with native iOS push, tap → listing URL

### Claude can do solo (queue)
2. FMV audit — fix known-bad estimates (GT2RS comp crossing, 1987 Carrera undervalued)
3. Deal/watch alerts re-enable — 1 line in main.py when ready
4. AutoTrader image coverage improvement (~80% currently)
5. Sold comp backfill (more BaT history depth)

### Needs owner input
7. New scrapers — owner researching which dealer-heavy sources are worth building
8. BMW M / Alpina support — scope TBD
9. Interactive pricing graph — discuss in Lead Dev chat
10. Manual FMV calculator — discuss in Lead Dev chat

---

## 10. Proxy & Infrastructure

- **DataImpulse** rotating residential `gw.dataimpulse.com:823`
- Mandatory for AutoTrader + eBay. Never falls back to bare IP.
- cars.com, Rennlist, BfB, DuPont: direct curl_cffi (no proxy needed)
- BaT, pcarmarket, C&B, PCA Mart: direct Playwright (no proxy needed)

## 11. Session Log

### April 19, 2026 — PWA Push Notifications
- iMessage replaced entirely with native iOS Web Push (notify_push.py)
- push_server.py: Flask app on :5055, VAPID Web Push, multi-subscriber, auto-prunes expired subs
- docs/sw.js: push event handler added, notification click → opens listing URL in Safari
- docs/notify.html: subscriber page at ocx11.github.io/PTOX11/notify.html — shareable link
- Cloudflare Worker: ptox11-push.openclawx1.workers.dev — permanent stable URL
- Cloudflare account: openclawx1@protonmail.com, workers.dev subdomain: openclawx1
- Self-heal: update_tunnel_url.sh redeploys Worker on every reboot with fresh tunnel URL
- 3 new launchd services: com.ptox11.pushserver, com.ptox11.cloudflared, com.ptox11.update-tunnel-url
- main.py: all notify_imessage calls replaced with notify_push

### April 18, 2026 (late evening — PCA Mart + data layer fixes)
- PCA Mart pagination fixed — f-string semicolon escaping bug in evaluate() calls caused only 11/85+ listings to be scraped. Rewrote all evaluate() calls to pass body as JS argument. Now returns 53+ listings across 39 pages.
- PCA Mart false-sold fixed — partial scrape was triggering mark_sold on 74 cars. Added 50% threshold guard in persist_scrape: if scraped count < 50% of active count, skip sold-marking entirely. 74 listings restored to active.
- 90-day archive rule — archive_stale_listings() added to db.py, wired into main.py after each scrape cycle. Listings with date_last_seen > 90 days ago → status=sold, archive_reason=stale_90d.
- upsert_listing UPDATE now refreshes date_first_seen when scraper provides a newer date (for PCA Mart LASTUPDATED renewals).
- PCA Mart LASTUPDATED date parsing fixed — CF format "April, 18 2026 14:32:00" now correctly parsed to ISO "2026-04-18". Existing malformed dates in DB corrected via one-time UPDATE.
- _ALLOWED_MODELS expanded: 930, 964, 993, 996, 997, 991, 992, gt3, gt4, turbo added. Rennlist listings titled "1996 993 Cabriolet" now pass the filter.
- Source chip filter fixed — cards now carry data-src-label matching badge label; JS does exact match on that instead of partial dealer name match. BaT/BfB chips now correctly filter.
- Commit: 730882e61

### April 18, 2026 (evening — scraper fixes)
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXED:** All scrapers (BaT, PCA Mart, BfB, Rennlist) were emitting `url=` instead of `listing_url=` in their listing dicts. `upsert_listing` couldn't match by URL, so new listings from these sources were never created as new DB records — they were silently absorbed into existing year/model matches. Fix: `scraper.py` (BaT + PCA Mart), `scraper_bfb.py`, `scraper_rennlist.py` all updated to emit `listing_url=`. `main.py` now reads `car.get("listing_url") or car.get("url")` as fallback for all scrapers.
- **live_feed import crash fixed:** `main.py` was importing `live_feed as lf` (deleted file) — would have crashed next full scrape cycle. Removed import and all 3 call sites.
- Verified post-fix: BaT 42 active all have URLs, BfB 11/11, Rennlist 5/5, PCA Mart 11/11. New listings from these sources will now create correctly going forward.
- Commit: 08d53ec8e

- Dashboard redesign approved — next major task
