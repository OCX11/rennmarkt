# Vehicle Market Analyzer — Project Handover Summary
*Last updated: April 16, 2026 (auction countdown timer added)*

---

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

A Porsche-focused market intelligence platform running autonomously on a Mac Mini M4. Scrapes 9 active sources (ALL LOCAL — Distill cancelled April 15), tracks price history, scores every listing against FMV using 5,770+ BaT/C&B sold comps, and sends iMessage alerts the moment a new listing hits the DB. Long-term goal: become the most informed buyer in the air-cooled, water-cooled, and GT Porsche market.

### Business Context
Owner operates a small, focused performance car dealership. All purchases are investments — short-term flips or long-term holds. Core price range: $70K–$150K. GT/collector cars have no ceiling.

## 2. Target Vehicles

### Tier 1 — GT / Collector (alert immediately)
- 911: GT3, GT3 RS, GT2, GT2 RS, R, Speedster, Sport Classic, Touring (996/997/991/992)

- Cayman: GT4, GT4 RS, Spyder, R (987/981/718)
- Boxster: Spyder (987/981/718)
- Any Turbo S variant
- 356, 914-6

### Tier 2 — Standard (alert only at DEAL — 10%+ below FMV)
- 911: Carrera, S, 4S, GTS, Targa (996/997/991/992)
- Cayman: S, GTS (987/981/718)
- Boxster: Base, S, GTS (987/981/718)

### Never
- Cayenne, Panamera, Macan, Taycan — excluded at scrape level
- Salvage, rebuilt, flood, frame damage
- Year: 1986–2024 | Mileage: <100k | Price: <$5,000 (non-auction)
- **⚠️ HARD RULE — YEAR_MAX=2024:** Do not change this to 2025 or 2026 under any
  circumstances. Applies to scraper.py and ALL scrapers. Owner decision required before
  any year ceiling change. Locked until Jan 1, 2027 at the earliest.

## 4. Active Data Sources

| Source | Method | Status | Listings | Images |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PCA Mart | `scraper.py` cookie-auth | ✅ Working | ~72 | ❌ Local paths |
| Bring a Trailer | `scraper.py` Playwright | ✅ Working | ~40 | ✅ Yes |
| cars.com | Distill Desktop | ✅ Working | ~18 | ❌ No |
| AutoTrader | `scraper_autotrader.py` | ⚠️ Intermittent | ~9 | Via link preview |
| pcarmarket | `scraper.py` | ✅ Working | ~9 | ✅ Yes |
| Built for Backroads | Distill Desktop | ✅ Working | ~9 | ✅ Yes |
| eBay Motors | `scraper_ebay.py` Browse API | ⚠️ Degraded | ~7 | ✅ Yes |
| Rennlist | `scraper_rennlist.py` | ❌ BROKEN | 11 stale | ✅ Yes |

**Total active: ~179 listings (was ~350+ at peak — Rennlist + eBay degradation)**

### Source Notes
- **Rennlist:** Returns 0 on every run — 403 block on proxy+Playwright. Existing 11 listings are stale/stuck. Fix needed urgently (high-value private seller source).
- **eBay Motors:** Collapsed from 81–293 listings at launch to ~7 active. No explicit errors — likely OAuth token or query issue. Investigate.
- **AutoTrader:** Zeros out ~50% of cycles (Akamai mobile site). Known issue. Dedicated chat for fixes.
- **cars.com (scraper_carscom.py):** Intentionally parked — Cloudflare blocked. Distill feeds it instead.
- **Cars.com (capitalized):** Legacy duplicate dealer name — archived April 9. Now all under `cars.com`.

### Proxy
DataImpulse rotating residential (`gw.dataimpulse.com:823`).
- Username: 7dffcde9c33e2eab45cb
- Password: 068a3aeba25658b5
- Balance: ~$50 topped up April 1 (~16 months runway)
- **Policy: mandatory, no bare-IP fallback** on AutoTrader/Cars.com scrapers

## 5. Database

| Table | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| listings (active) | ~179 | Down from ~350 peak |
| listings (sold/archived) | ~1,200+ | Historical |
| sold_comps | 5,710 | Growing — FMV truth layer |
| bat_reserve_not_met | 1,784 | Price floor signal |
| hagerty_valuations | 22 | Good condition only |

---

## 6. FMV Engine

`fmv.py` — wired into dashboards and alerts every cycle.
- Source: BaT sold comps (weight 1.0)
- Groups by: generation + trim family
- Recency decay: full weight ≤6 months, decays to 0.3 at 24 months
- Outputs: weighted median, price_low/high, RNM floor, confidence, comp count

---

## 7. Alert System — LIVE ✅

**File:** `notify_imessage.py`
**Recipient:** 6108361111

### Two-layer alert system (order each cycle):
1. **`notify_new_listings(conn, new_ids)`** — fires for EVERY new listing the moment it hits DB. No FMV required. Format:
```
🆕 NEW: 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS
💰 $289,000
🛣️  8,400 mi
📍 Bring a Trailer [AUCTION]  [GT/Collector]
🔗 https://bringatrailer.com/listing/...
```

2. **`notify_imessage.main()`** — deal/watch scoring alerts. Format:
```
🔥 DEAL: 2022 Porsche 911 GT3
💰 $239,900  -15% vs FMV ($282,000)
🛣️  12,000 mi
📍 AutoTrader [RETAIL]  [GT/Collector]
🔗 https://...
```

**Thresholds:**
- Tier 1: alert on DEAL (10%+ below) OR WATCH (5–10% below)
- Tier 2: alert only on DEAL (10%+ below)
- Price floor: listings under $20,000 skipped (auction bids / salvage)
- Confidence gate: NONE confidence skipped
- Dedup: `seen_alerts_imessage.json` — new-listing key `"new:{url}"`, deal key `"{url}"`

---

## 8. Dashboard — GitHub Pages ✅

URL: https://ocx11.github.io/porsche-tracker/
- Auto-regenerated every scrape cycle by `new_dashboard.py` → `docs/index.html`
- Auto-pushed to GitHub every 2 minutes by `git_push_dashboard.sh`
- Filters: Generation, Model, Year, Price, Source, Deals only, GT/Collector only
- No pre-checked filters on load ✅
- Listing age shows accurate timestamps (uses `created_at`, not `date_first_seen`) ✅
- All report links working ✅

---

## 9. Open Issues & Next Steps

### 🔴 Fix Now
1. **Rennlist scraper broken** — 403 on every run. Proxy+Playwright being blocked. Fix in Rennlist chat. High value source — private sellers, GT/air-cooled.
2. **eBay Motors collapsed** — ~7 listings vs 200+ at launch. Investigate OAuth/query in eBay chat.
3. **AutoTrader zeros ~50% of runs** — Akamai block on mobile URL. Fix in AutoTrader chat.

### 🟡 Short Term
4. **Cars & Bids active listings** — handoff prompt ready in C&B chat. High Tier 1 value.
5. **Built for Backroads → Playwright** — last Distill dependency. Cancel Distill sub after.
6. **PCA Mart image URLs** — local `/static/img_cache/` paths don't send via iMessage.
7. **archive-capture daemon** — undocumented, runs every 10 min. Audit what it does.
8. **Legacy dashboard** — `dashboard.py` still generating `static/dashboard.html` every cycle. Dead output. Remove from `main.py`.

### 🟢 Medium Term
9. **FMV accuracy audit** — some cars way off. Likely generation bucketing issues.
10. **PWA / iOS app** — add `manifest.json` to `docs/`. 2-hour build, installs from Safari.
11. **eBay sold comps** — eBay Finding API gives sold listings. Gold for air-cooled FMV.

### 🔵 Phase 4 (needs 30+ days data)
12. Price trend prediction, velocity signals, seasonality, buy/sell score

## 10. Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Rennlist 403 block | High | BROKEN — fix in Rennlist chat |
| eBay Motors collapse (200→7) | High | Investigate OAuth/query |
| AutoTrader ~50% zero cycles | Medium | Known — Akamai mobile block |
| PCA Mart images local-only | Low | `/static/img_cache/` not public |
| archive-capture undocumented | Low | Needs audit |
| Legacy dashboard.py still running | Low | Dead output, remove from main.py |

## 11. Session Log

### March 26–30, 2026
- BaT backfill: 5,652 comps | eBay Browse API activated | DataImpulse proxy activated
- FMV pipeline wired | iMessage alerts live — 98 alerts first run

### April 1, 2026
- `scraper_autotrader.py` built (mobile site, bootstrap complete)
- DataImpulse topped up $50

### April 2, 2026
- `scraper_carscom.py` built (curl_cffi, 61 listings, 100% images)
- `scraper_ebay.py` built (Browse API, OAuth2, 81 listings)
- `enrich_ebay_mileage.py` built

### April 4, 2026
- `scraper_rennlist.py` built — Rennlist migrated off Distill
- Distill now only serves Built for Backroads

### April 8, 2026
- iMessage new-listing alerts wired (`notify_new_listings`)
- Dashboard live feed filter removed
- All dashboard links fixed (live_feed path, GitHub Pages)
- `.gitignore` hardened (data/, secrets, img_cache excluded)
- Scheduler fixed: 1800s → 720s (30 min → 12 min)
- `enrich_rennlist.py` removed from run loop
- `git_push_dashboard.sh` created — GitHub Pages auto-updates every 2 min
- Listing age display fixed (created_at vs date_first_seen)
- Independent dealers disabled from DEALERS list
- iMessage alert wiring restored in main.py after git restore wipe

- **pcarmarket prices** — extracted via `span.pcar-auction-info__price` selector. Was hardcoded None. 4/5 active listings now have prices. `$0` = auction started, no bids yet (valid).
- **Comp mileage fix** — was stripping `49k-Mile` prefix BEFORE extracting mileage. Now extracts mileage first, then strips. 24 air-cooled comps backfilled via `enrich_bat_vins.py` visiting listing pages. 96% of 911/Cayman/Boxster comps have mileage.
- **PM thread note** — this PM chat is very long. Start a fresh thread when tool call limits become frequent. Bootstrap new thread with HANDOVER.md content.

### April 16, 2026 — Auction Countdown Timer
- **auction_ends_at column** added to listings table (TEXT, ISO UTC)
- **BaT** — reads `data-timestamp_end` Unix epoch from each `div.listing-card` card attr, converts to ISO UTC string
- **C&B** — parses `span.ticking` HH:MM:SS countdown text at scrape time, adds to `datetime.now(UTC)` to get absolute end time
- **db.py upsert_listing** — accepts and stores `auction_ends_at` in both UPDATE (COALESCE) and INSERT
- **main.py** — threads `auction_ends_at` through from all scrapers to DB
- **new_dashboard.py** — `data-ends` attribute on `span.countdown` elements; JS `updateCountdowns()` fires every 1s, formats as Xd Xh Xm or Xh Xm Xs, shows red "Ended" when expired
- **fmv.py** — `auction_ends_at` added to `score_active_listings()` SELECT
- 39/48 active auctions now carry end time (BaT 39; pcarmarket N/A — no end time on their cards)
- commit fe5d7ee57

### April 16, 2026 — Comp Scraper Overhaul + Search UI
- **BaT comp scraper rebuilt** — replaced slow Playwright HTML scraper with JSON API using nonce auth (50x faster)
- **Sales vs RNM correctly separated** — "Sold for $X" = actual sale (sold_price set), "Bid to $X" = reserve not met (sold_price NULL). Was previously treating all as sales, inflating FMV.
- **Year filter 1986→1950** — air-cooled 911s (930/964/993/pre-964) now correctly captured in comps
- **Trailing slash URL normalization** — fixed duplicate detection bug that caused known comps to be missed
- **Page-level stop logic** — stops when entire page is known, not on first known URL (BaT returns mixed-age results)
- **Daily auto-run wired in** — comp_scraper now runs once per day via timestamp file (data/last_comp_scrape.txt). Will never go stale again.
- **Gap filled** — 5,789→6,004 comps, March 25→April 15 fully recovered
- **Searchable listing history** — docs/search.html built, 2,747 listings, filters: VIN/model/trim/source/price/miles/status. Regenerates every scrape cycle. Linked from dashboard nav.
- **GitHub repo renamed** — porsche-tracker → PTOX11 via API. manifest.json, sw.js, new_dashboard.py, git remote all updated.
- **Sold comps dashboard** — was showing data only through March 25; now current through April 15

### April 15, 2026 — Full Build Session
- **Cars & Bids active listings** — `scraper_cnb.py` built, Playwright scrolls 24K px, 12 listings, 100% images, AUCTION category
- **Built for Backroads → Playwright** — `scraper_bfb.py` built, kills last Distill dependency, 12 listings, 100% images
- **Distill subscription cancelled** — ALL 9 sources now on local scrapers, zero cloud dependency
- **FMV audit** — NONE confidence 14→0, HIGH 134→145, trim fallback logic fixed (GT3 Touring→GT3, Carrera 4S→Carrera), ⚠️ LOW CONF warning added to deal alerts under $15k or >70% discount
- **PCA Mart thumbnails** — synced 27 new images to docs/img_cache/, pushed to GitHub Pages
- **PWA installed** — manifest.json, sw.js, icons already built; user installed as iPhone app via Safari
- **eBay mileage enrichment** — ran enrich_ebay_mileage.py, 0 mileages added (eBay private sellers don't fill specs — expected)
- **archive_capture** — confirmed useful: HTML + screenshot of every listing saved to archive/ every 10 min
- **iMessage alerts** — confirmed all 9 sources firing, images sending correctly for all HTTP image_url listings
- **GitHub private repos** — FREE on personal accounts; keeping repo public because Pages requires public on free plan
- **231 active listings** across 9 sources, 5,770 sold comps

### April 9, 2026 — Post-Audit
- **Audit performed** — Claude Code cold-read of full system
- `notify_gunther.py` removed from `run_daily.sh` (Telegram dead, was running every cycle)
- Alert price floor added: listings <$20k skipped (BaT auction bids / salvage)
- `Cars.com` (capitalized) duplicate archived — all normalized to `cars.com`
- HANDOVER.md rewritten to reflect actual system state (not aspirational)
- **Key findings:** Rennlist broken, eBay collapsed, AutoTrader intermittent, 179 active vs 350+ expected
